I am currently doing an assignment in a course called "Model-driven 
testing" and am writing about gauge in a very basic manner. I have some 
questions I'd like to ask you, the team behind it:

Q1. What are your reasons for developing Gauge in the first place and 
why did you settle on the particular technology you're using for Gauge? 
(Behaviour-driven testing or acceptance tests, using plugins etc)
Q2. What situations are Gauge good for, and less suitable for?
Q3. How mature do you think Gauge is as an automated testing tool? Is it 
suitable for use by companies developing real-world software at scale? 
Why / why not?
Q4. How do you plan to evolve and develop Gauge going forward? What are 
the main improvements needed to take the tool to the next level?

Thank you for you time!
